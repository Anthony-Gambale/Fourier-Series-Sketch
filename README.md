# Fourier-Transform-Sketch
This program takes any curve as input, and approximates it using rotating vectors of different frequencies and lengths using the complex-valued fourier transform. It then re-constructs the curve by animating the tip-to-tail sum of these vectors.

### Install and Run
Simply download all files in the repository, and open index.html in any browser. Then draw any closed curve you like. This program does not need to be run on a server to function properly.
