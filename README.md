# Fourier-Transform-Sketch
This program allows the user to draw any curve. It then breaks the curve into core frequencies of rotating vectors using numeric integration, and re-constructs the curve by animating the tip-to-tail sum of these vectors.

### Install and Run
Simply download all files in the repository, and open index.html in any browser. Then draw any closed curve you like. This program does not need to be run on a server to function properly.
